####COMP 551 - Mini-Project #2

##IMPORTANT:
Before running all of the cells, please make sure to understand that running with "run_search=True" will run for more than 2 hours. 
You may take a look at the previous outputs of the plots at the end of the notebook, prior to running all. 
While "run_search=False", no plots will appear, but there will be an instance of logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes and SVC that will 
run for both datasets (except SVC is only digits). Therefore, the bar plot will be available at the very end of the notebook.
Running with "run_search=False" will take approximately 2 minutes.

Please make sure all the following libraries are installed:

- pandas (0.25.1)
- numpy (1.16.5)
- opencv-python (cv2 for short) (4.4.0.44)
- matplotlib (3.2.2)
- scikit-learn (0.21.3)
